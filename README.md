## A Simple Chat App in Meteor

This is a bare-bones chat app.

### Installation

1. Install [Meteor.js](https://www.meteor.com/install). On OS X or Linux, installing Meteor consists of running this command from the terminal:

    ```bash
    curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
    ```

2. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:somodernized/simple-chat.git
    ```

3. Run Meteor:

    ```bash
    cd simple-chat
    meteor
    ```

4. Open the app in two different browser tabs: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/). When you type in one tab, the messages will instantly show up in the other tab without refreshing the page. Cool!

That's it!
